/**
 * A Renderable contains all information about a single render instruction (typically a draw call).</p>
 * <p>
 * It defines what (the shape), how (the material) and where (the transform) should be rendered by which shader.</p>
 * <p>
 * The shape is defined using the mesh, meshPartOffset, meshPartSize and primitiveType members. This matches the members of the
 * {@link IntMeshPart} class. The meshPartOffset is used to specify the offset within the mesh and the meshPartSize is used to
 * specify the part (in total number of vertices) to render. If the mesh is indexed (which is when {@link IntMesh#getNumIndices()} >
 * 0) then both values are in number of indices within the indices array of the mesh, otherwise they are in number of vertices
 * within the vertices array of the mesh. Note that some classes might require the mesh to be indexed.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #material} and (optional) {@link #environment} values are combined to specify how the shape should look like.
 * Typically these are used to specify uniform values or other OpenGL state changes. When a value is present in both the
 * {@link #material} and {@link #environment}, then the value of the {@link #material} will be used.
 * <p>
 * Renderables can be rendered directly using a {@link IntShader} (in which case the {@link #shader} member is ignored). Though more
 * typically Renderables are rendered via a {@link IntModelBatch}, either directly, or by passing a {@link IntRenderableProvider} like
 * {@link IntModelInstance} to the RenderBatch.
 * <p>
 * A ModelInstance returns all Renderables via its {@link IntModelInstance#getRenderables(Array, Pool)} method. In which case the
 * value of {@link IntModelInstance#userData} will be set to the {@link #userData} member. The {@link #userData} member can be used
 * to pass additional data to the shader. However, in most scenario's it is advised to use the {@link #material} or
 * {@link #environment} member with custom {@link Attribute}s to pass data to the shader.
 * <p>
 * In some cases, (for example for non-hierarchical basic game objects requiring only a single draw call) it is possible to extend
 * the Renderable class and add additional fields to pass to the shader. While extending the Renderable class can be useful, the
 * shader should not rely on it. Similar to the {@link #userData} member it is advised to use the {@link #material} and
 * {@link #environment} members to pass data to the shader.
 * <p>
 * When using a ModelBatch to render a Renderable, The Renderable and all its values must not be changed in between the call to
 * {@link IntModelBatch#begin(com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Camera)} and {@link IntModelBatch#end()}. Therefor Renderable instances cannot
 * be reused for multiple render calls.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link #shader} member of the Renderable is set, the {@link IntShaderProvider} of the {@link IntModelBatch} may decide to
 * use that shader instead of the default shader. Therefor, to assure the default shader is used, the {@link #shader} member must
 * be set to null.
